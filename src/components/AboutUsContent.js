          Nepal Community Development Center(NCDC) is established in 1991. It is
          also registered in Social Welfare Council. It is recognized as a
          leading NGO in Jhapa district of Nepal. The main vision of the
          organization is to uplift the community members through conducting
          different community focused programs.

          With support and cooperation from various resources and donor
          agencies, as well as its internal resources, NCDC is conducting
          different community-based activities that are reaching rural and
          remote communities of Jhapa district.

          Through sustainable and responsible growth and with the donation of
          the land from the local government, NCDC has established its own big
          office complex. It includes office facilities, training halls, canteen
          and residential facilities for up to 100 people. NCDC has also
          established three community buildings at rural areas of the district.
          These buildings are regularly used by local women groups. NCDC has 5
          full time staff to run the day to day work of the organization. NCDC
          is self-sufficient in its operational cost and therefore, any fund
          received from the donors is fully devoted for the operation of the
          projects/programs.
